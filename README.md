# Inside Out


The Inside Out website redesign project focuses on enhancing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for Pixar's popular feature film, "Inside Out," and its sequel, "Inside Out 2." The goal is to create a more engaging, intuitive, and visually appealing website that captures the essence of the films while providing users with a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience.
